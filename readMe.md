# Hockey Statistics Webpage

## How It's Made:

**Tech Used:**  JavaScript, Java, Hibernate, Maven, Spring, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, MySQL

This project was built for a client. They wanted a simple local website for their NHL tournament. It's designed for ease of use for non-coders. In order to add players and stats to the database, all users need to do is type the localhost in their browser and create an account. After an account is created, users can navigate to the players tab and enter a player and their stats. No coding required.

## Optimizations

I'd like to add pictures of the player's face (possible copyright issues???) and add some animations. I would like to eventually host the site so anyone can use it. I also need to make the front-end prettier.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that there is almost always a way to futher automate and optimize something and that hard coding is almost never the answer to a problem. I originally received the data from an excel spreadsheet. Rather than enter data into my database manually, I found a way to transfer the data from excel over to MySql which helped me avoid hard coding the data.

Also, I will never again say "Lets do one more thing and then the project is done." Projects are never done. There is always a weird issue to deal with or an improvement that can be made. Projects, like the void, are endless. There is no escape.
